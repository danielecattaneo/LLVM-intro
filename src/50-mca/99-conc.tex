\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
We have seen:
\begin{itemize}
\item On which principles LLVM-MCA is based
\item How to use LLVM-MCA and how \alert{not} to use it
\item Which results can be achieved and what other factors 
	influence the speed at which your code runs
\item How LLVM-MCA is implemented and some hints on where to look
	if you want to expand or improve it
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
Have fun optimizing your programs!
