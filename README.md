# LLVM-intro
Introduction to LLVM compiler framework

## About
This repository holds the source files for course material I used in a few
talks introducing the LLVM compiler framework.

These slides are strongly based on material written by E. Speziale, M. Scandale,
and S. Cherubin (https://github.com/skeru/LLVM-intro).
