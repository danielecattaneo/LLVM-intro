# LLVM-intro
Introduction to LLVM compiler framework

## About
This repository holds the source files for course material I used in a few talks introducing the LLVM compiler framework.

This material is strongly based on material written by E. Speziale and M. Scandale.
Here you can find the first public version of the source code. I asked their permission before making it public.
